    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "Ans: Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method."

    "Ans: The Class Attribute is available to all the instance objects of that class. whereas Instance Attributes are accessible only to the object or Instance of that class. A single copy of Class attributes is maintained by pvm at the class level. Whereas difference copies of instance attributes are maintained by pvm at objects/instance level.\n"

    "Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?\n",
    "Ans: Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters."
