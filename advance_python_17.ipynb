    "Ans: The Main difference between Greedy and Non Greedy Match Syntax is The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible Whereas The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible."

The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. If only Non Greedy Match is available, we can use other filtering or pattern matching methods of regex and further identify the required pattern."
