    "Ans: The output of the above is 1 5 6 5. The reason for this function not throwing an error is because, this function expects 4 arguments. The value for argument a is provided explicitly whereas for arguments b and c, the function will expand the *(5,6) and consider the value of b as 5 and value of c as 6. Since the default value of d is provided in function declaration d value will be 5. However it is recommended to use the feature of positional arguments at the end."

Eventhough Python gives importance to indentation, its provides a facility to declare an entire function in one single line, where statements in a function body are sepereated by ; . When l,m,n are provided as inputs to the function, it modifies the values of m,n and sets the value of m=['x'] and n={'a':'y'}. l=1 as it is because l is immutable but m and n are mutable."
